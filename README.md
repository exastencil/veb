This is a pet project to build my own Gemini client. The Gemini protocol is 
simple enough that one should be able to write a minimal client in an
afternoon. This gives great power to users who can then precisely customise
the experience they want.

## Goals

* TLS Support (with certificate management)
* Interactive CLI mode
* Support Nerd Fonts
* 16-color support
